<p><strong>I DOOM SCROLL FOR MY PLEASURE (themed collection)</strong>
<br>
<br>
<u>A teenhood (116 syllables)</u>
<br>
<br>
For many years I have drowned in light.<br>
Some magnetic impulse to stare and fiddle.<br>
These sounds (click, tap) mollify me, as image<br>
After image<br>
After cuboid image burns into retina,<br>
Red, green, blue! And so they last. Last week,<br>
Didn’t you weep while scrolling through Twitter (application)? What was that beautiful Post? In 2015,<br>
Didn’t you watch a man beheaded?<br>
In how many ways – name them – did Kik (application) occasion your change?<br>
What does this evoke for you?
<br>
<br>
For many years I have curated my image.<br>
I have primped. I have accepted my cuteness. I have turned down marriage proposals.<br>
Well, two.<br>
On each Site, I exploit and delight in profilities, my likeness, my name. Such options.<br>
I read somewhere, an artist: “It’s an industrial Internet,” he said. “Full of islands.”<br>
Upon this I ponder. This German’s right. Which others?<br>
Click: List of Germans who are/were right. List of Germans. List of dead Germans. List of right things. List of things.
<br>
<br>
For many years I have lived halfly.<br>
Or rather, felt to be half-living. My feelings aren’t true – that’s natural.*<br>
But, yes,<br>
There is some sheet of mottled glass that separates. That slows cognition. That slows time. That turns 3 receptionless days into a cleanse. That prompts to google search, how to stop google searching?<br>
I’m a google search addict, AMA.<br>
Or don’t, and don’t speak to me, look at me, shine light upon me. Whatevz. Who cares.<br>
My Vit D-deficient attitude works against you.
