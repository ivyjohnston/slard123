<p><strong>I DOOM SCROLL FOR MY PLEASURE (themed collection)</strong>
<br>
<br>
<u>Small portrait</u>
<br>
<br>
You resent those who experience the Internet unintelligently but you who experience it intelligently lack the articulation of your literary heroes (these men: Don Dave Edward John – are you so male-pilled, where are your token inspirational girlbosses? At heart, Jewess fag, a bigot). You latch yourself onto ghosts of perceptions of fantastical relations. You don’t ‘date’, unbeautiful child, but imagine parallel figures who traipse and tremble and intrigue: the boy you didn’t speak to; the girl you didn’t speak to. Your activities. The movies…
<br>
<br>
The movies and telephone conversations and looking things up and washing dishes and refreshing your empty e-mail. Still no job offer. Still no African prince. Still no hot Russian singles in your area pleading desperate blue-balled for your company/your sex/your sardonic comments on the State of Things. Just wait, or listen: for the silence that never comes.<br>
(You) (You btw) (That’s you)
