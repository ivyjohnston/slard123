<p><strong>I DOOM SCROLL FOR MY PLEASURE (themed collection)</strong>
<br>
<br>
<u>NOT A CELLPHONE IN SIGHT (the olden days)</u>
<br>
<br>
An observation: we are all dolls.<br>
Painted porcelain pretty faces posited in petty position<br>
Why pray ruin this placement? My larger<br>
more peculiar sister who practices her playing<br>
dolls, ponies, mummy daddy baby,<br>
Country Picnics,<br>
pianoforte, good posture, oil paints and pornography<br>
plays with me too. Sit there still and silent,<br>
says Sister, don’t wake sleeping baby (who I’m) (in jest) and<br>
the hours pass placid, pinky, pop. No lessons on a sunday.<br>
Evenings: we sup on Ambrosia, round-table’d, white child legs hanging<br>
Nights: clotted cot sleep; flannel sheets. <br>
Daytime Dolly dithers Dolly dum-dee-dums Dolly dries her eyes pour<br>
la leçon. Scene.<br>
