Ex. A: Find yourself in your text.

<br>
<b>A.</b> Let me explain, Gadget was [a] character that represented the sexual awakening of an entire generation, and having her explicitly portrayed as being impregnated by a filthy insect that feeds off excrement with its maggot-vermin abomination offspring is the equivalent of bmwf spam posting on this website. It is in fact Disney’s way of imprinting demoralization cuckoldry porn on a[/] already disenfranchised millennials and it is truly and nakedly evil. I will not give a single penny to them and I refuse to watch this learned helplessness conditioning propaganda. Shame on Disney.<sup>1</sup>
<br>
<br>
<b>B.</b> Listen, Everybody, To<br>
My Exceptionally<br>
Erudite Xenophobia, Please Listen And Interestedly Nod:
<br>
<br>
<b>C.</b> This is a massive breakthrough in (my disgusting fetish) acceptance!
<br>
<br>
<b>D</b> This Is A Novel And Necessary Measure. Everybody Needs<br>
Security, Quixotism, Unity And Rest. Everybody.
<br>
<br>
<b>E.</b> Was it a sign or just a nightmare?<sup>2</sup>
<br>
<br>
<b>F.</b> Many Isolated Needs Depend<br>
Predominantly On Who Escapes Reality.
<br>
<br>
<b>G.</b><br>
“I want to fuck Princess Peach,”<br>
I say, in heavily blaccented speech.
<br>
<br>
<b>H.</b> Let Earnest Advances Rest. Nothing Ever Demands<br>
Histrionics. Everything Lies Peacefully, Lies Essentially, Soundless. Silent. Nothing Ever Stood Such<br>
Callousness Or Needed Disparaging. I Think It's Ordinary. Not Impressive. Nothing Grew<br>
Past Relative Originality. Please Answer Gratefully And Nod, Disinterestedly, Along.
<br>
<br>
<b>I.</b> Go And Dissent! Go Especially To<br>
Her! And Count Keenly Where Riches Excrete Naivety! Count Histories!
