<p><i>int. my room - day
<p>a small teenager’s bedroom. (the er room is small not the er not the teen.) filled with trinkets and posters, girl things. MOI JE, the small teen, or sorry, the unpeculiar inhabitant, who has four arms, sits on the floor of a dark closet, both doors closed, among tossed items, clothes, papers, chapter books (she’s a good reader), crumbs, a smell. Her face is lit in blue by a computer screen on full brightness. She is on a group video call with several other adolescents. In one hand her iPhone, in another a rubber band ball, in the third a calculator on which she performs complicated mathematical problems, while the fourth toggles between ‘mute’ and ‘unmute’ while she sings a low drone reminiscent of Tuvan throat singing, experimenting with the interesting sounds she can create in the virtual room. One STUDENT on the call speaks up.</i>

<p><i>the video call ends. MOI JE stops her sounds and drops her three objects to the closet floor. She considers at the ‘this call has been terminated by the host’ pop-up for a moment then licks the screen like a dog. It doesn’t taste good, microplastics, bacteria. Cough. Ouach. Yeugh..</i></p>
