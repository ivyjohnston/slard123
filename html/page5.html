<p><strong>I DOOM SCROLL FOR MY PLEASURE (themed collection)</strong>
<br>
<br>
<u>A sober investigation into identity and identity crises – liberal delight</u>
<br>
<br>
I’M ‘QUEER’; I’m relaxed.<br>
I lead a sedentary lifestyle,<br>
I pose difficulties. I believe in<br>
My latent homosexuality,<br>
My feminist theories,<br>
My pleasant situation.<br>
Reading is a challenge for me, as are<br>
Good manners. I believe in<br>
The new world. And crocodile teeth and their deeper meanings, and<br>
Pilates, and the theories behind it.<br>
I idolise Kellogg and Freud, who feed me smooth compact spoonfuls of knowledge,<br>
Er, contradictory tastes,<br>
Er, vegetables at war. (Here comes the Bomber jet, Mund auf auf auf!)<br>
I can’t be trusted behind the wheel<br>
(Of Fortune, my millions,<br>
My weepy girls in bikinis, my<br>
Weepy private jets?)<br>
I fail at every test:<br>
Patience, Provisional License, Atomic Power,<br>
I’m large. Huge actually. My name<br>
Couldn’t be longer. I believe in<br>
Love, or something like it, or<br>
Stucco ceilings and sticky buns<br>
My history of catfishing is catching up to me. I called<br>
I called myself Candice, or Clarice, or Claire,<br>
And dutifully played my role.<br>
(ASL? Do u trade? Ever fucked your dog?)<br>
Or something like it.<br>
William Powell says I’m like a white lily: coolly virginal yet expertly inviting.<br>
He’s looking at Ann Harding but really talking to me,<br>
I practice my transatlantic accent,<br>
I practice my Gypsy Rose Lee routine,<br>
I practice my piano accordion.<br>
I only play mouldy instruments.<br>
I’m an expert in my field,<br>
Which might be anything because I’m Clarice and Candice and<br>
Claire, and goalless and bloated and fucked. I believe in<br>
Miracles and Hot Chocolate<br>
And Facebook Marketplace. I don’t believe in a<br>
Higher plane, or the Easter Bunny.<br>
I’m a coloniser. I’m vast.<br>
The country can’t stretch to contain my enormous self. Nor wants to, I don’t belong here.<br>
I belong in Firenze with Florence Nightingale, who says:<br>
Claire, you’re a good person.<br>
Claire, I envy your small waist and high spirits.<br>
Claire, I think I might love you.<br>
I tell Florence to such a dick dirty dyke. I enjoy, in secret, my medically confirmed lesbianism.<br>
It’s not real. Squorkle let me down.<br>
The Google Document let me down.<br>
Q let me down, Anonymous, my father,<br>
David Attenborough let me down.<br>
I believe I wasn’t meant to be alive in this century,<br>
Or at all, because my head is just<br>
So small it doesn’t quite make sense. Hats don’t fit me. They’re not fashionable. They’re not chic.<br>
I should be a bad bitch, that girl, a slay queen. I am covered in dirt and pustules.<br>
Slay queens are squeaky clean, or look it.<br>
William Powell let me down.<br>
I believe I was meant to be rich and handsome,<br>
Descendent of schemes,<br>
Of clarified salts, of<br>
Ancestral incestual relations,<br>
But I am rigid and pussy,<br>
Doomed to end the bloodline.<br>
I am fascinated by sexual perversion.<br>
I pretend to be Iranian online.<br>
I draw swastikas in crayon.<br>
I am a threat to the local ecosystem.<br>
My mother wants me to meet somebody. My mother is overseas, or dead, or waiting for me in the other room,<br>
<i>Mad Men</i> on pause for a tea-and-piss break.<br>
Or something like that. I believe in<br>
Don Draper’s failing marriage, in<br>
Don Henderson’s party, in<br>
Don Delillo’s <i>Underworld</i>, in<br>
My quickness of wit and lightness of foot, and my<br>
Inability to say kind things.<br>
<i>Pink for girls and blue for boys</i> is my motto.<br>
I plead to Reddit: How to cleanse my soul of blue light, of square eyes?<br>
I thank kind strangers for their golds. I thank my fans for top comment.<br>
Grazie, gracias, ci-mer, danke, schön, schön, schön! White people rejoice!<br>
Tomorrow is Friday!
